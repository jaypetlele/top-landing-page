# top-landing-page
Landing page project for The Odin Project

-   For this project I have to create a landing page using the skills I learned
    in html and css

- I have learned in this project that there is more than one way to solve a problem
- That things can get frustrating at times and the best way is to retrace and take your time
- Mistakes do happen and it's fine
